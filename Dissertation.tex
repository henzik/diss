\abstract
In recent years, mobile technologies seem to be evolving faster than our lives can adjust; yet many users still use traditional systems instead of adopting newer solutions. One such system is the loyalty card, which is disadvantaged by being often misplaced and open to abuse. To bring loyalty services into the digital age, a system `Stamped' was designed, implemented and evaluated. Stamped allows businesses to design, deploy and manage any simple loyalty scheme, using Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies as a means for users to collect stamps and claim rewards on their smartphones. In our analysis, we quantify the value of gamification in our system, and recommend future opportunities in light of upcoming developments in the fields of contactless technologies.
